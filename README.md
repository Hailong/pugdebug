# pugdebug

pugdebug is (well, should be) a PHP standalone debugger.

A python 3.4.x, pyqt5 project.

# using it

The main dependencies are Python 3.4,
[QT5.4](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html),
[SIP4.6](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download)
and [PyQt5.4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5).

I wrote a [blog post](http://robertbasic.com/blog/install-pyqt5-in-python-3-virtual-environment)
about setting up a virtual environment for it.

Clone this repo and after setting up the virtual environment simply doing a 
`python app.py` should start up pugdebug.

# executables

I'm trying to make executables with [pyqtdeploy](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqtdeploy/download).
So far I managed to create one for Fedora 21.

# todo
